        <p>My name is Ning Zhang. In Chinese culture, we place our surnames before our given names, so you can call me Zhang Ning (<em>ZHANG</em> is my surname).I was born and raised in China, and this is the first time I am studying abroad. <br>My program is <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>, but this is not my first post-secondary education. I obtained my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering about ten years ago. But unlike most of my peers, I did not become an engineer. Instead, I have worked as a patent agent and legal consultant in the patent field before deciding to study in Canada.</p>
        <p>The motivation behind choosing my program is that photography has been my greatest passion since I got my first camera four years ago. It has become my preferred way of self-expression. Just as my favorite photographer Daido Moriyama(A Japanese photographer who became famous from the 60s and 70s of 20<sup>th</sup> century, and best known for his black-and-white street photography) said: <blockquote>For me, photography is not a means by which to create beautiful art, but a unique way of encountering genuine reality. -<cite>Daido Moriyama</cite></blockquote>The attached portrait of me below was taken by myself using my own camera and enhanced with post-processing. <br>Last year, my photographs and AI-generated images were featured in some Chinese art exhibitions. These experiences prompted me to consider pursuing a full-time career in photography or design. Additionally, I had grown tired of my previous work and lifestyle, so I planned a fresh start. That's the reason behind my decision to study abroad, which ultimately led me to my current program. It offers more than just photography, including video production and web design, allowing me to build more artistic skills and have the opportunity to earn a living from them. <br>I'm happy to meet you and learn from you.</p>
